## For Real implemetation go to [basics.py](../basics.py) and for [Lambda](../lambda-how-2.py)
Absolutely — this approach is excellent. Teaching Python **through the lens of boto3** from the very start is efficient and keeps your learners focused and motivated.

Below is a **sequential set of Python scripts** that each teach **one core Python concept** while already using **realistic boto3-related examples** (even if mocked at first). This way, they **build Python skills and AWS automation intuition side-by-side.**

---

## 🧪 Assumptions:

* Learners know *basic terminal use* and *have AWS credentials set up* (or will use a mocked boto3 client early on).
* You can demo actual boto3 calls while they write and test locally with mocked data, then test against AWS later.

## 📚 Sequential Python Scripts — Basics with Boto3 Context

Each script builds on the previous one. You can do one script per lesson.

---

### **🟢 Script 1: Variables & Print with AWS Context**

📄 `1_variables_and_print.py`

```python
# Simulate AWS info
aws_region = "us-west-2"
bucket_name = "my-first-s3-bucket"

print("AWS Region:", aws_region)
print("S3 Bucket Name:", bucket_name)
```

🧠 Teaches: Variables, strings, print
🛠️ Real context: Region and bucket variables are used in every boto3 script.

---

### **🟢 Script 2: Lists & Loops — Simulate S3 Buckets**

📄 `2_lists_and_loops.py`

```python
# Pretend we got this list from boto3
s3_buckets = ["my-data-bucket", "logs-bucket", "archive-2023"]

print("Listing S3 Buckets:")
for bucket in s3_buckets:
    print(" -", bucket)
```

🧠 Teaches: Lists, `for` loop
🛠️ Real context: Listing buckets — a typical boto3 task.

---

### **🟢 Script 3: Dictionaries — Simulate EC2 Instances**

📄 `3_dicts_and_loops.py`

```python
# Simulated EC2 instances from boto3
instances = {
    "i-1234567890": {"Name": "WebServer", "State": "running"},
    "i-0987654321": {"Name": "DBServer", "State": "stopped"},
}

print("EC2 Instance Info:")
for instance_id, details in instances.items():
    print(f"{instance_id} - {details['Name']} ({details['State']})")
```

🧠 Teaches: Dicts, nested access, `.items()`
🛠️ Real context: EC2 responses from boto3 are dict-heavy.

---

### **🟢 Script 4: Functions — Wrap logic**

📄 `4_functions_basics.py`

```python
def describe_instance(instance_id, instance_info):
    name = instance_info["Name"]
    state = instance_info["State"]
    return f"{instance_id} - {name} ({state})"

# Sample data
instance = {"Name": "AppServer", "State": "running"}
print(describe_instance("i-1122334455", instance))
```

🧠 Teaches: Functions, parameters, return
🛠️ Real context: Describe or format AWS resource outputs.

---

### **🟢 Script 5: Conditionals — Filter Resources**

📄 `5_conditionals.py`

```python
instances = {
    "i-1": {"Name": "App1", "State": "running"},
    "i-2": {"Name": "App2", "State": "stopped"},
}

for id, info in instances.items():
    if info["State"] == "running":
        print(f"{id} is active.")
    else:
        print(f"{id} is not active.")
```

🧠 Teaches: `if`, `else`
🛠️ Real context: Filter EC2 instances, Lambda functions, etc.

---

### **🟢 Script 6: Exception Handling — Simulate boto3 error**

📄 `6_exception_handling.py`

```python
def get_bucket(bucket_dict, name):
    try:
        return bucket_dict[name]
    except KeyError:
        print(f"Bucket '{name}' not found!")

buckets = {
    "logs": {"region": "us-west-2"},
    "archive": {"region": "us-east-1"},
}

get_bucket(buckets, "data")
```

🧠 Teaches: `try/except`, KeyError
🛠️ Real context: Handle missing AWS resources (like with `ClientError`)

---

### **🟢 Script 7: Import & Simple boto3 call — List Buckets**

📄 `7_list_buckets_boto3.py`

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
response = s3.list_buckets()

print("Your S3 Buckets:")
for bucket in response["Buckets"]:
    print("-", bucket["Name"])
```

🧠 Teaches: Importing modules, basic boto3 call
🛠️ Real context: First real interaction with AWS

---

### **🟢 Script 8: File I/O + JSON — Load Config**

📄 `8_file_io_and_json.py`

```python
import json

with open("config.json") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

print("Backup bucket:", config["bucket"])
```

🔹 `config.json`

```json
{
  "bucket": "my-backup-bucket"
}
```

🧠 Teaches: File reading, JSON
🛠️ Real context: Load settings for boto3 scripts

---

### **🟢 Script 9: Upload File to S3 — Simple Automation**

📄 `9_upload_file.py`

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.upload_file("test.txt", "my-backup-bucket", "backups/test.txt")
print("Uploaded test.txt to S3.")
```

🧠 Teaches: Using boto3 to act
🛠️ Real task: Upload file — common automation need

---

### **🟢 Script 10: Final Mini Project (Combine All)**

📄 `10_s3_backup_script.py`

* Load config from JSON
* Get list of files in a folder (`os.listdir`)
* Upload all files to S3 with error handling
* Log uploaded files to `log.txt`

🧠 Teaches: End-to-end scripting with real-world relevance
🛠️ Real context: Daily automation like backups

---

## 🔁 Teaching Strategy Tips

* Use **mock data first**, then transition to **real boto3 calls** once they understand the logic.
* Provide **starter scripts** or **scaffolds** with some code filled in, especially early on.
* Add **optional CLI args** later using `argparse` to enhance the final project.
* Reinforce each concept with short **boto3-focused exercises**:
  e.g., “Write a function to return only running EC2 instances”

Would you like me to bundle these into a GitHub-style repo or zip structure with comments for each script?
