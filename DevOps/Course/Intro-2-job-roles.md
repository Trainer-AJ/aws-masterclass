# 📘 Absolute Prerequisite for Learning DevOps

**Video Title:** *Absolute Prerequisite for Learning DevOps*  
**Topic:** Understanding the DevOps Engineer’s workflow, how requirements flow through an organization, and how Jira supports the process.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This video explains the **day-to-day workflow of a DevOps engineer**, detailing:

- Where requirements originate  
- How they flow through the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**  
- How tools like **Jira** are used for project tracking and collaboration

## 1. 🧩 Key Roles and the Requirement Flow in an Organization

The video uses an example of a **DevOps Engineer at Amazon Fresh** to illustrate how business requirements evolve into deliverables.

| **Role** | **Key Function(s)** | **Example of Artifact / Action** |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Customers** | Provide feedback and drive requirements for the business. → [04:41] | Sharing a need for a *15-minute grocery delivery service.* → [05:39] |
| **Business Analyst (BA)** | Interacts with customers and business to gather requirements and document them. → [06:12] | Prepares a **Business Requirement Document (BRD)**. → [06:48] |
| **Product Manager (PM)** | Defines the product vision and prioritizes requirements from the BA. → [08:11] | Decides the *15-minute delivery service* must be completed in **Q1 (Jan–Mar)**. → [08:41] |
| **Product Owner (PO)** | Converts the vision into actionable items and manages the backlog. → [09:10] | Breaks down the requirement into **Epics or Features** (e.g., UI required, backend implementation). → [09:41] |
| **Solutions Architect (SA)** | Defines the technical system structure and frameworks. → [10:47] | Prepares **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)** for developers. → [11:10] |
| **Scrum Team** | Collaborates to complete the requirement — includes Developers, QA, and DevOps engineers. → [15:37] | Developers create features, QA tests them, and DevOps provides infrastructure. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Works with developers and architects to create necessary infrastructure. → [13:55] | Creates **Kubernetes clusters**, writes **Dockerfiles**, sets up **Git repositories**. → [13:18] |
| **SRE Engineer** | Ensures reliability and uptime once the feature is live. → [16:21] | Builds **dashboards**, **metrics**, and **notifiers** for monitoring. |

## 2. 🧱 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **SDLC** defines the structured flow of a requirement through multiple stages. → [22:52]

| **Phase** | **Description** | **Driven By** |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Planning** | Requirements are gathered. | Business Analysts (BAs) |
| **Analysis** | Requirements are analyzed for feasibility and importance. | Product Managers / Product Owners |
| **Design** | Architects create **HLD** and **LLD**. | Solutions Architects |
| **Implementation** | Development, infrastructure setup, and integrations take place. | Developers, DevOps, QA |
| **Testing & Integration** | Features are tested and validated (often automated). | QA / DevOps |
| **Maintenance** | Continuous reliability and uptime monitoring. | SRE Engineers |

## 3. ⚙️ The DevOps Engineer’s Two Primary Responsibilities

A **DevOps Engineer** plays a dual role across development and operations.  

### 🧩 1. Fulfilling Developer Requirements
> Provide the infrastructure and resources developers need to build and deploy efficiently. → [23:48]

**Examples:**
- Creating and managing **infrastructure** (e.g., servers, Kubernetes clusters).  
- Setting up **CI/CD pipelines** and **repository integrations**.  

### 🚀 2. Improving Efficiency
> Identify gaps in the SDLC and automate processes to speed up delivery. → [24:03]

**Examples:**
- Integrating **QA automation scripts** into CI/CD pipelines to trigger tests automatically. → [24:44]  
- Adding **security checks** (DevSecOps) to pipelines. → [25:24]

---

## 4. 🗂️ Project Management with Jira and Scrum

Work progress and coordination are tracked using **Jira**, providing visibility to management and stakeholders. → [27:34]

### 🧱 Epics and Stories
- The **Product Owner** creates an **Epic** — a large business requirement (e.g., *15-minute delivery service*).  
- The **Scrum Team** breaks it into smaller, actionable **Stories** or tasks. → [31:03]

### 🔁 Scrum and Sprints
- The team follows the **Scrum methodology** within Agile.  
- Work is done in **Sprints** (typically **2–3 weeks**). → [34:16]

### 👨‍💻 DevOps Work in Sprints
- During **Sprint Planning**, the team reviews the **Backlog**.  
- If a developer requests something (e.g., “I need a Kubernetes cluster”), a **new Story** is created and assigned to the DevOps Engineer. → [37:51]

### 📊 Tracking Work
- The DevOps Engineer updates the **status and progress** of each Jira Story.  
- This allows **management and stakeholders** to track real-time work visibility. → [40:53]

## 🧠 Summary

- DevOps bridges **development**, **operations**, and **business** functions.  
- Understanding **SDLC**, **Agile/Scrum**, and **Jira workflows** is essential for DevOps engineers.  
- The key is not just to build infrastructure, but to **automate**, **optimize**, and **collaborate** effectively across teams.
