# Overview
[AWS Page](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/)
- AWS CodePipeline [unified CI+CD] is a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. CodePipeline builds, tests, and deploys your code every time there is a code change, based on the release process models you define. This enables you to rapidly and reliably deliver features and updates
- AWS CodeBuild [classic build] is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you don’t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue.
- AWS CodeDeploy [classic release] automates code deployments to any instance, including Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications.

🎯 Overview

This video provides an introduction to DevOps, explaining what it is, why it emerged, and how to discuss your experience in a DevOps interview.

1. 🧩 What is DevOps?

Key Point	Description / Fact	Citation (Timestamp)

Fundamental Definition	DevOps is a culture or a practice adopted in an organization that improves its ability to deliver applications.	[02:46] / [03:05]
The End Goal	The main objective is to increase the speed of application delivery — ideally taking hours or a couple of days, not weeks.	[05:05] / [05:09]
DevOps is More Than CI/CD	While many equate DevOps with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), it is a broader concept.	[05:49] / [05:55]
The Four Pillars of DevOps	The complete definition includes four key aspects that speed up delivery:	[08:19]
1️⃣ Proper Automation	Automating repetitive and manual tasks.	[09:42]
2️⃣ Maintaining Quality	Ensuring code and application quality.	[09:47]
3️⃣ Continuous Monitoring	Also called Observability — tracking performance and errors.	[09:58]
4️⃣ Continuous Testing	Automating tests throughout the lifecycle.	[10:19]

⚙️ Example of Delivery Speed

If a company (e.g., PUBG or example.com) takes 10 days to deliver a new version or critical fix, that’s slow and inefficient.
→ [03:55]

If Android has a security bug, they must release a patch within hours or a couple of days to protect users.
→ [04:41]


✅ DevOps enables this rapid deployment.

2. 🏗️ Why Did DevOps Emerge? (The Shift from the Old Model)

⚠️ The Problem (Old Model)

The old process (over a decade ago) was slow, manual, and involved multiple siloed teams.
→ [19:53]


👥 Old Roles Involved

Role	Responsibility	Timestamp

System Administrator	Created the server (using VMware/OpenStack) for testing.	[17:36]
Build & Release Engineer	Deployed the application code (from SVN/CBS) to the server.	[18:42]
Server Administrator	Set up the Application Server (App Server).	[18:58]


🐢 The Inefficiency

Delivering code from a developer’s laptop to production took 10 days to a month due to manual handovers and lack of automation.
→ [19:27]

🚀 DevOps Solution

DevOps automates the entire process. → [20:00]

It unites previously separate teams into a single collaborative culture. → [21:15]

Result: Faster, consistent, and efficient delivery.

3. 💬 How to Introduce Yourself in a DevOps Interview

When introducing yourself for a DevOps Engineer role, structure your answer as follows: → [23:36]

🧑‍💻 Current Experience

> “I have 4–5 years of experience working as a DevOps Engineer.”
→ [24:13]



🧠 Previous Background

Mention your prior experience (e.g., System Administrator, Build & Release Engineer, Java/Python Developer) to show foundational skills.
→ [25:01]

🔧 Roles & Responsibilities

Frame your experience around the Four Pillars of DevOps → [26:19]:

🔁 Automation — Managing CI/CD and process automation. → [26:26]

🧪 Quality — Ensuring code/application stability. → [26:33]

📈 Monitoring — Setting up observability and alert systems. → [26:37]

🧩 Testing — Integrating continuous testing into pipelines. → [26:41]


🧰 Optional: Tools & Technologies

Mention relevant tools briefly:

> GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Kubernetes (Container Orchestration), Ansible (Configuration Management), Terraform (Infrastructure Automation).
→ [27:11]

📺 Summary:
DevOps is not a tool or technology — it’s a culture focused on speed, automation, quality, monitoring, and testing to achieve rapid, reliable delivery.
